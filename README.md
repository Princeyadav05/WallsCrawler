# Setup
 #### Requirements 
 ```
 sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt
 ```
 #### Executing the Script
 ```
 python3 wallpaper-downloader.py
 ```
 
# Points to Remember
The script will return error if a wallpaper with the same name already exists in the WallHaven folder.
To avoid these, copy the pre-exisiting wallpapers somewhere else.
